Kamailio-ISUP7-Csharp
A Low-Level C# Library for SS7-ISUP Protocol Implementation for SIP-T

This repository contains a low-level library written in C# that implements the SS7-ISUP (Signalling System No. 7 – ISDN User Part) protocol for SIP-T (SIP for Telephones). Inspired by the Kamailio sipt.c module, this library is designed to enable developers to build and integrate SS7-ISUP functionalities into SIP-T environments.

Overview
The purpose of this library is to provide a robust, flexible, and extensible foundation for:

Encoding and decoding ISUP messages according to ITU-T Recommendation Q.763 and ANSI T1.113.
Integrating with SIP-T systems to support telephony applications that require low-level signaling.
Serving as a reference implementation for projects that need to interact with legacy SS7 networks.

Features
Low-Level ISUP Message Handling:
Implements message format, parameter encoding, and decoding per ITU-T Q.763 and ANSI T1.113 standards.

SIP-T Integration:
Designed to integrate with SIP-T systems, allowing for seamless interoperability between SS7 signaling and SIP-based applications.

Modular Architecture:
Cleanly separated modules for message parsing, encoding, and transport that can be extended or adapted for specific use cases.

Reference Documentation:
This library is built using guidelines from ITU-T Q.763 (12/1999) and ANSI T1.113 documents. For further details, please refer to these standards.

Getting Started

Prerequisites
.NET 6.0 (or later)

Visual Studio 2022 or your preferred C# development environment

Installation
Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/ranvli/kamailio-ISUP7-Csharp.git
cd kamailio-ISUP7-Csharp
Build the Solution: Open the solution in Visual Studio and build it, or use the .NET CLI:

dotnet build
This library is intended to be integrated into larger SIP-T or telecommunication projects. Below is a basic example of how to use the library for encoding an ISUP message:


public void EncodeISUPMessage()
{
    // Create a new ISUP message instance
    var isupMessage = new ISUPMessage(MessageType.IAM);
    
    // Set mandatory fields, e.g., Circuit Identification Code (CIC)
    isupMessage.SetCIC(1234);
    
    // Add other parameters as needed
    isupMessage.AddParameter(ParameterType.CallingPartyNumber, "5551234");
    
    // Encode the message into a byte array
    byte[] encodedMessage = isupMessage.Encode();
    
    // Use the encoded message as needed (send over network, etc.)
}

For a detailed guide on message structure and additional usage examples, please refer to the Documentation.
